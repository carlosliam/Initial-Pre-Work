// I was previously familiar with subtracting from string.length in brackets.

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
